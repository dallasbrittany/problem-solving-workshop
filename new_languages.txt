Notes:

The idea for these questions is to explore new languages, languages that may be very different from the ones previously learned. For example, if you are used to C++, then Prolog is a totally different world and very much worth exploring. In some languages, the problems given are extremely easy; and, in other languages, they may be much more complicated.
