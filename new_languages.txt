Notes:

The idea for these questions is to explore new languages, languages that may be very different from the ones previously learned. For example, if you are used to C++, then Prolog is a totally different world and very much worth exploring. In some languages, the problems given are extremely easy; and, in other languages, they may be much more complicated.

Write "Hello, World" in 5 different programming languages you have never used.

Write an infinite loop in 2 programming languages you have never used.

Generate a random number in a programming language you've never used.

Print a list backwards in a programming langauge you've never used.

Create an array in a language you've never used.

Read a file with a list of integers in a language you've never used.

Create a finite while loop with a counter in a language you've never used.

Determine which years are leap years in a language you've never used.
